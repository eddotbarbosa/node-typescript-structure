### Recommended Node TSConfig Settings
You can let TypeScript compile as little as possible by knowing what the baseline support for ECMAScript features are available in your node version, for more info access [node target mapping](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Node-Target-Mapping) in microsoft typescript repository.


You can also use https://github.com/tsconfig/bases/ to find tsconfig.jsons to extend, simplifying your own JSON files to just the options for your project.
